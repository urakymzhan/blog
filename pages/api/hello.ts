// Just an example on how to create api enpoints in Next

// Do Not Fetch an API Route from getStaticProps or getStaticPaths

// You should not fetch an API Route from getStaticProps or getStaticPaths. Instead, write your server-side code directly in getStaticProps or getStaticPaths (or call a helper function).

// Here’s why: getStaticProps and getStaticPaths runs only on the server-side. It will never be run on the client-side. It won’t even be included in the JS bundle for the browser. That means you can write code such as direct database queries without them being sent to browsers.
